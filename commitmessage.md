👌Done 

-  🛠️ fixing the some issues in the notifications section , the issue was that the data comes from the server as it is put in the server , then the method `Ojbect.keys()` and `Object.values()` was used this methods sort the keys alphabetically  , then a for loop with the index used so the data was put wrongly the object that holds it in the component . 

✔️To-do

1. adding validations on the User inputs 

2. adding unit testing 

3. adding functional documentation
